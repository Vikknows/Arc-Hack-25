# Features

### 1. Salary Deposit Engine

Choose salary amount, instant % slice, max wait hours, and baseline FX.
The backend stores deposits and compares:

- instant conversion
- delayed conversion
- optimisation routing

### 2. Real-Time FX Optimiser

Runs Python logic that simulates market conditions ("Good", "Neutral", "Bad")  
and decides how much of the salary queue to convert.

### 3. Circle Wallet Integration

Backend hits Circle’s wallets API using:

- `CIRCLE_API_KEY`
- `ENTITY_SECRET`
- wallet set + wallet IDs

The frontend fetches this via a `Refresh wallet` button.

### 4. Neon React Dashboard

Beautiful UI built with:

- React
- Vite
- Custom CSS (glass + neon effects)
- Full animated layout
